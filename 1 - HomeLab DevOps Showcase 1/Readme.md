I developed and executed a project called "Deploying and Managing a Virtualized Kubernetes Cluster with ELK Logging and Grafana Monitoring" to showcase my proficiency in DevOps. The goal was to demonstrate my abilities in deploying and managing a virtualized Kubernetes cluster, integrating ELK logging and Grafana monitoring to provide visibility into the cluster's performance and health, and utilizing tools like Ansible, Terraform, and Git.
To execute the project, I utilized hardware such as HP Elitedesk G3 Mini with an i5-7500 processor, 32 GB RAM, and 1 TB NVME, and software such as virtualization software, CentOS 7 or higher for the virtual machines, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Grafana, and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
The project involved several steps, including setting up the virtual environment and network by creating virtual machines for the CentOS and ELK cluster nodes, deploying the Kubernetes cluster using Ansible, and integrating ELK logging and Grafana monitoring to provide visibility into the cluster's performance and health.
This project highlights my skills to future employers and my ability to execute complex projects in the DevOps domain. I demonstrated my proficiency throughout the project using DevOps tools such as Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, ELK, Terraform, Git, and Grafana. I also showcased my ability to design, deploy, and manage complex infrastructure and applications using virtualization.
