I created a "DevOps HomeLab Showcase" project that demonstrates my proficiency in DevOps and showcases my skills to future employers. In this project, I used my work laptop to access servers and hardware, and I used my desktop PC to dual boot into Linux and run all the nodes as virtual machines using VirtualBox or VMware Workstation.
I designed the project to include CentOS, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, ELK, Terraform, Git, and Grafana, all free-to-use DevOps tools. The project involves creating an infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform to quickly spin up and shut down the virtual machines that run the nodes. Ansible is used to configure the nodes with all the necessary packages and dependencies for the applications. Docker is used to containerize the applications, and Kubernetes is used to orchestrate the containers.
I used the ELK stack to collect and analyze logs from the applications running in the containers and Grafana to visualize the performance and health of the applications. Ansible and Terraform are used to automate the configuration and deployment of the applications and infrastructure, and Git is used to versioning control the code and configuration files.
For hardware, I used a Cisco 891-K9 891 router, a Cisco ASA 5505 firewall, Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch, an eight-port patch panel, and a Netgear AX3600 (WAX620PA) wifi 6 AP to provide network connectivity and wireless connectivity to the nodes.
Overall, this project demonstrates my proficiency in DevOps and highlights my experience using these tools to design, deploy, and manage infrastructure and applications in a secure and scalable way. It showcases my ability to automate tasks, configure environments, monitor logs, and visualize metrics, all while using best practices and safe network design.
