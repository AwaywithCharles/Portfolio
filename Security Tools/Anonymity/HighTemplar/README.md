## High Templar

High Templar is a Python program that allows you to change the MAC address of your network interface. It was created to expand Python knowledge and for use in a HomeLab environment.

The program is named after the Protoss High Templar unit from the Starcraft universe, known for its powerful psionic abilities. High Templar uses the netifaces library to interact with the network interface and generate random MAC addresses.

The program is currently licensed under the MIT License, allowing open-source contributions and improvements. In the future, the program will be made cross-platform to allow for use on multiple operating systems.

Please note that the program may present bugs, but it primarily works as intended. Any contributions or feedback from the community are welcome to help improve the program's functionality.

Thank you for using High Templar.
