# Portfolio

This Repo is just a repository to collect my notes, ideas, and projects open to the public as I work on and develop them.  Some will be very organized. Others not so much.  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.  

I am really just using this to start demonstrating my capabilities and share some projects that I may have finished or havent finished that others may find useful.  

In the future I will sort it more to list complete projects and incomplete projects.
