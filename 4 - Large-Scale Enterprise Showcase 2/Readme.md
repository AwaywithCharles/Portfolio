I built and deployed a microservices-based application using a CI/CD pipeline. I used various DevOps tools and practices, including Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana, to demonstrate my proficiency in these technologies. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience building and deploying a scalable and customized application using a CI/CD pipeline that can meet the specific needs of a Fortune 100 company.
The project involved creating a Git repository and writing the code for a microservices-based application using Java and Spring Boot. I containerized each microservice using Docker and tested them locally. Using Jenkins, I set up a CI/CD pipeline to build the Docker images, run tests, and deploy the microservices to a Kubernetes cluster. I used Kubernetes to deploy and manage the microservices on the cluster and implemented service discovery and load balancing using Kubernetes services and ingress. I then used Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application's health and infrastructure.
The repository structure includes directories for the microservices code, Dockerfiles, Jenkinsfile for the CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes deployment and service files, Prometheus configuration file, Grafana dashboard configuration file, and project documentation.
