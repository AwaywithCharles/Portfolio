This project is a CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices Architecture using Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes, demonstrating my proficiency in DevOps tools and practices.
This project aimed to build and deploy a microservices-based application using a CI/CD pipeline. The project involved several steps, including code development using Java and Spring Boot, containerization using Docker to containerize each microservice, and testing the microservices locally.
Next, I used Jenkins to set up a CI/CD pipeline to build the Docker images, run tests, and deploy the microservices to a Kubernetes cluster. I also used Kubernetes to deploy and manage the microservices on the cluster, implemented service discovery and load balancing using Kubernetes services and ingress, and used Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health of the application and the infrastructure.
Additionally, I used Git branches to manage code changes and merge them into the main branch, Git tags to mark important milestones in the project, and Git hooks to automate specific actions in the repository, such as running tests or building Docker images.
By completing this project, I have demonstrated proficiency in various DevOps tools and practices, including Git, Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and Grafana. I also gained hands-on experience building and deploying a microservices-based application using a CI/CD pipeline.
